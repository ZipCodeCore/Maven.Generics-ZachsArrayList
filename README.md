# GenericArrayList MicroLab
In chapter 8.1, the book discusses how ArrayList is implemented without the use of Generics.  In this lab, you're given a rudimentary ArrayList without generics and you must make the tests pass.

The actual functions have been written for you, as have the tests that test those actual functions.

What you have to do is make finish the ImplementationTest class and get those tests to pass.  There are notes above each of the methods that you must make pass.
